#summary How to run the eclipse project.

= Introduction =

So, you've checked out the Eclipse project and now you are curious how to run everything.  We will start by configuring the `edu.arizona.simulator.ww2d.Main.java` through the Run Configurations option in Eclipse.

Under the Arguments tab, we need to add several VM arguments in order to make everything work properly.  My personal VM arguments configuration looks as follows:

{{{
-Xmx2048m -Djava.library.path="natives/linux/"
}}}

The first argument increases the java heap size to 2GB.  We don't technically need that much space, but I really dislike program crashes because we've run out of heap space.

The second argument sets up the `java.library.path` to point to the natives directory.  Depending on your platform, you will specify a different directory.  For example if you are running on windows the correct directory will be `natives/windows/` and for mac the correct directory is `natives/macosx/`.

You should now be up and running.  To change the configuration files, we currently just edit the `Main.java` file.  Look for the line that creates a new GameplayState and gives it several arguments.  One fo those arguments points to the location for the room initialization file and another points to the location for the agent initialization file.
